# Enhancing Glitch Identification in Gravitational Wave Analysis: A Continual Learning Approach
This repository contains the code and resources for my Master's thesis at Open Universiteit. It focusses around the integration of continual learning in the detection and classification of glitches. First the original Gravity Spy dataset is used via a pre-trained Resnet-18 architecture. The second experiment involves integration of auxiliary channel data (fractal dimensions) and the third experiment is a multi-modal architecture integrating the first two architectures (image and fractal dimension data).
